#Goal
'''
Predict house prices based on features like:
-Number of bedrooms/bathrooms
-Square footage
-Neighborhood
-Year built
-Lot size
'''

#Concepts
'''
-Regression problem, not classification
-Instead of predicting categories, we predict a continuous number(Price)
-We'll practice:
    -Handling missing data
    -Encoding categorical features
    -Scaling numeric features
    -Training regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)
    -Evaluating performance with metrics like RMSE or RÂ²
