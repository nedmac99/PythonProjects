# Oxygen Concentrator Inventory Management System

## 📦 Overview

The **Oxygen Concentrator Inventory Management System** is a Python-based command-line tool designed to help healthcare organizations or service technicians manage the inventory of oxygen concentrator units. The system supports multiple unit types, tracks warranty details, monitors repair statuses, and calculates revenue based on customizable business logic.

It supports three categories of concentrators:
- 🏠 **Home Concentrators** — Stationary units often used in residences.
- 🎒 **Portable Concentrators** — Lightweight and mobile units for travel or active patients.
- 👶 **Pediatric Concentrators** — Specialized units with child-specific flow rate limitations.

This program is ideal for small teams that require a lightweight, easy-to-maintain system that still offers persistent storage and structured inventory tracking.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Receive Units**  
  Add new concentrator units to the inventory, each with its own model, RMA number, warranty type, revenue, flow rate, and type-specific fields (e.g., noise level, battery level, or patient age).

- **Ship Units**  
  Remove units from inventory when they are shipped or deployed, ensuring real-time updates to stock records.

- **Repair Status Management**  
  Track the repair status of each device. You can check or update whether a unit has been repaired or is still pending maintenance.

- **Warranty Type Lookup**  
  Allows users to query and confirm the warranty type for any unit based on its RMA number.

- **Revenue Calculation**  
  Dynamically calculates the total revenue generated by all units currently in stock, based on model and warranty combinations.

- **CSV Persistence**  
  Inventory is saved to and loaded from a `units.csv` file automatically, preserving data across sessions without requiring a database.

- **Validation and Business Rules**  
  - Flow rate for Pediatric units is limited to 2L or less.
  - Duplicate RMAs are not allowed.
  - P2 models cannot have "Manufacture" or "QM Warranty" types.

## 📁 File Structure

- `o2_inventory.py` — Main program file with all logic.
- `test_o2_inventory.py` — Test file to establish unit testing on functions within main o2 inventory program
- `units.csv` — Auto-generated file storing inventory records.
- `requirements.txt` — Text file that stores the pip-installable libraries needed for this program


The CSV structure includes fields for unit type, model, RMA, warranty, revenue, flow rate, repair status, and optional fields depending on unit type.

## 🧱 Class Design

The program uses object-oriented programming principles for clarity and flexibility.

### `Concentrator` (Base Class)
Attributes:
- `_model`, `_rma`, `_warranty_type`, `_revenue`, `_flow_rate`, `_is_repaired`

Methods:
- `get_info()`, `__str__()`

### Subclasses
- **`HomeConcentrator`**: Adds `_noise_level`  
- **`PortableConcentrator`**: Adds `_battery_level`  
- **`PediatricConcentrator`**: Adds `_age`

Each subclass overrides `get_info()` to include its specific properties.

### `Inventory` Class
Holds a private `_stock` list and includes methods to:
- Receive and ship units
- View inventory and revenue
- Query or update warranty and repair statuses

## 📊 Revenue Logic

Revenue is calculated automatically using model + warranty type:

| Warranty Type | 525DD / EVERFLOW | 1025DD | P2 |
|---------------|------------------|--------|----|
| Manufacture   | $45.00           | $75.00 | ❌ |
| Flat Rate     | $299.98          | $375.98| ✅ |
| QM Warranty   | $0.00            | $0.00  | ❌ |
